## UX

## Project Goals

The main project goal of Frasers Bakery website is to increase local awareness of a bakery that aims to be a hub for the local community. As this type of amenity will be used by everyone the website needs to be easy to navigate, understandable and legible with information that is easily obtainable. 

### Customer goals

The customer age range is a huge demographic, young children from potentially 10 years old all the way to the elderly.

Customer goals are:
* It needs easily accessible on all devices.
* Easy to navigate through the website.
* Easy to read and legible.
* Able to see images to what products are on offer.
* Social links to what the bakery is up to.
* Are able to visit the bakery in-person.

All these goals are possible due to:
* Responsive design is at the forefront of development.
* Continuity and modern HTML methods will be used through the project.
* Contrasting colours and easy to read fonts have been incorporated.
* There are several areas where social links are available.
* Address/interactive map will be available.

### Collaborators / Potential business partners

Collaborators goals are:
* Wanting to understand the companies story/background.
* Professional website feel but understands the clients needs.
* See what products are available.
* Where the bakery is situated.
* Social links to have a better understanding of the bakery.
* An area to submit project ideas/get in touch.

All these goals are met due to:
* A detailed story will be presented within the website.
* Products will be easily accessible through an easily located navigation bar.
* One of the main links in the navigation bar is "Where are we?" so that users can easily locate the bakery.
* A full section of the website is dedicated to "Work with us" which gives the user a feeling that the business is serious about working together.
* Social links are scattered through the website across all devices.

## Design Choices

The overall feel of the website will be designed to be simple but enjoyable to read. The following design choices were picked for these specific reasons:

### Fonts

- The primary font is **Noto Sans**. This was chosen for its readability. Good spacing between characters and suits the simplicity design aim. This font will make up the bulk on the writing where as the secondary will be for headings and titles.

- The secondary font is **Oswald**. This was chosen strict structure and that it would play well for being the dedicated font for the titles and headings.
- Both fonts that are mentioned will have a fall back of sans serif.

### Icons

The icons which will be present will be used for their metaphorically and literal meanings so they are understood by everyone.

### Colours

 - The primary background would be beige/flour feel to represent the bakery and heading/logo/title and text would be dark blue and light blue which would have a good contrast against the background. This should go with the design feature of being easily read.
 - A dark blue colour will be used as the line breaks and potentially the mobile heading bar.
 - The colour's which will be picked will be consistent through the project.
 - ![Colour Scheme](/assets/readme-images/primary-colours.png)

### Images

- The images which will be presented will be basic and to the point. Images will be of bakery goods and possibly what the bakery looks like.

### Styling

- All buttons and text boxes will be smoothly rounded to give the website a soft feel.
- Break rectangles will be present to be specific with when one section ends and one starts.
- The writing will nicely spaced to make it readable. Titles will be a decent amount of space between itself and the following writing or information (maps/images etc...).

### Further Testing

- The website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera.

- The website has been tested on all screen sizes and responsive media queries support this through the web developer tools.
- The website has been tested on a laptop and also on an iPhone.
- Family and friends have also tested the website.

All links which are present work:
- Social icons take the user to new tab with the requested webpage.
- The submit buttons on the forms take the user to a thank you webpage to show that link works.
- Navigation buttons at the top take the user to the correct part of the webpage.

### Fixed Bugs

On the menu.html, when the screen sized decreased the menu figcaption would shoot off to the right. I fixed this using a media queries when the screen got to this size:

<img width="213" alt="bug-menu-items" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b3900f-4685-4dcf-8af8-945184db3ec6">

There was another bug which caused an invisible gap along the right side to appear when the screen sized reached to mobile. I fixed by making the the wee review section to having a more responsive textarea which only had max-width 70% instead of touching the sides of the screen when the screen got to mobile view. This fixed it.

<img width="215" alt="Bug-gap" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af139302-ee92-4a66-8742-e1a850cedbaf">

Another bug which I encountered was that the header with navigation icons was going under the carousel and also the images which had the hover over effect. To fix I did a bit of trial and error and swapped the z-index from container.header to fixed.header and worked.

5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
6. Optionally, select **Copy the DEFAULT branch only**.
7. Click  **Create fork**.

### Content

- This gave me a better understanding of flex-box: [Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsTv9y931o8&t=524s)
- I used W3C schools and Stackover Flow for further understanding from the content through the Code Institute.

### Media

- Text came from https://www.violetcakes.com/about and then altered to suit the website.
- All images came from Pixabay.
- Address and map location is of: https://bigriverbakery.myshopify.com/pages/contact


### Code

- I was looking through tutorials in YouTube for inspiration and stumbled across this which was a simple but effective short piece of code:
[Smooth scroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc6G3oV24yE) This enabled me to smoothing transition to the "Where are we" section of the website instead of jumping.

<img width="186" alt="smooth-scroll" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8373cd2a-ffe6-4b2e-b480-924eec9a9e38">

- An addition to the navigation bar links was from hover.css: ![hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/#effects)
This created a grow and then rotate which is a nice, small design feature from an user experience POV.
